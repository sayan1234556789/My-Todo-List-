--- Building a TO-DO list ---

-- first take a state (array)

-- select element by queryselectors

-- add task ka function banau (create)
     -- input ko trim
     -- new object banau to push to the state {id,text,false}
     -- completed hai ki nhi
     -- push to the state
     -- input value ko firse khali kar do
     -- render kar do page ko

-- delete the task (delete)
    -- use filter to filter all the false o/p and build a state

-- Update the task as completed or not (update)
    -- use map() to traverse the state and if the id === id i want to complete print another state with spread operator and completed : !todo.completed
    -- else todo
    -- render

-- function of render(read)
    -- remove old todos because we are building the ui from new again
    -- e.g state["car wash" , "gym"] now on updation becomes ["car wash" , "gym", "study"]
    -- it will print like carwash, gym, carwash, gym, study
    -- its a problem so we clean the state first and then build the ui from the basic again
    -- we use queryselectorAll and select "todos" and use foreach(e => e.remove())
    
    -- recreate the state
       -- traverse in state using foreach
       -- recreate the div with createElement
       -- add css to it with classList.add("name of id/class in css")
       -- create span of name
       -- update the css
       -- update the textcontent

       -- logic for line throught the work if todo is completed
       -- give it a opacity
       -- now addEventListener of click to call the change of completed position
       
        -- delete botton create
        -- add css
        -- update the text content
        -- addEventListener of click and call the delete function 
        -- appendChild to span
        -- appendChild to deletebtn
        -- appendChild to todo div

    --- we have already done createElement then why we need appendChild?
        -- it is because createElement only create the element like div or span etc not on the page -> not attached to DOM 
        -- it only exist in memory
        -- when we appendChild it becomes a part of DOM
        -- browser can now render it and is visible        

-- addEventListener to add button to add a task


-- local storage add
    -- local storage saves as key-value pair
    -- only strings so
    -- todos (array of objects)
        ⬇
        Convert to string (JSON.stringify())
        ⬇
        Save to localStorage
        ⬇
        On page load → get it back
        ⬇
        Convert back to array (JSON.parse())
        ⬇
        Render()
